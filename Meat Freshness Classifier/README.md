# Meat-Freshness-Classifier-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN-
A deep learning project that applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify meat images into fresh, half-fresh, and not fresh categories. Includes source code and project documentation (PDF).

## Dataset  

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:  
**["Meat Freshness Image Dataset 2022"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinayakshanawad/meat-freshness-image-dataset/data)**  
by *Shanawad, V.*  

Each image is analyzed based on **color**, **texture**, and **surface characteristics** to determine its freshness level.

## Objective  

The purpose of this project is to:
- Demonstrate and enhance the capability of **CNNs** in visual classification tasks.  
- Develop a smart, AI-driven solution for **automatically identifying meat freshness**.  
- Evaluate the **efficiency and accuracy** of CNNs in distinguishing meat under varying conditions.  
- Explore the **practical application** of CNN models in real-world **food processing** and **retail** environments.
