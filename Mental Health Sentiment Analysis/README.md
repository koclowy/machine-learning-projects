# Mental-Health-Sentiment-Analysis
A machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) project that applies Decision Tree and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models to classify mental health-related text data into Normal and Depressed categories.   Includes source code, project documentation (PDF), and the cleaned dataset used for model training and evaluation.

## Dataset  

The dataset used in this project consists of **mental health-related text entries**, preprocessed and cleaned for sentiment classification tasks.  
It includes features such as textual responses and emotional indicators, labeled as **Normal** or **Depressed**.  

The **cleaned dataset** is included within this repository.

## Objective  

The purpose of this project is to:  
- Develop a **sentiment analysis model** capable of identifying mental health states based on textual input.  
- Apply both **Decision Tree** (traditional ML approach) and **RNN** (deep learning approach) models for classification.  
- Compare the **performance and accuracy** of these models to determine their effectiveness in mental health text analysis.  
- Demonstrate the **application of NLP and deep learning** in the domain of mental health research and support systems.
